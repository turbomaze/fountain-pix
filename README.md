Fountain Pix
====================================================================
[A Meteor.js app](http://fountain.meteor.com) that holds schools
accountable for maintaining their water fountains by empowering students
to record and report dirty spouts.

## Motivation
At this point, the negative impact of sugary beverages (SSBs) on a
person's health is uncontroversial. Drinking SSBs like soda can
lead to preventable diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, rotting teeth,
and more. Statistics show that teens consume disproportionately more
SSBs than any other age group.

One way to discourage SSB consumption is to increase access to water. There
are federal laws (USA) that require schools to provide free, clean water,
but at far too many schools in lower-income areas, the water fountains are
dirty, suspicious, and unappealing. Considering the pristine, soda-ridden
vending machines that abound in most high schools, it's no wonder students
often default to sugary drinks.

The easiest way to raise awareness about this easy-to-fix problem is to
show school administrators and local officials the types of fountains
students are expected to drink from. Fountain Pix provides a simple
interface for both documenting fountains and conducting student surveys
about fountain cleanliness.

## Usage
To encourage participation, this app has no registration system. Anyone
can add their school to the list on the homepage and begin taking photos
of all the dirty fountains in their area.

### Adding a new fountain
First, select your school from the list on the homepage (or add it). Then,
use the image upload button at the bottom of your school's page to add
a photo of a fountain. That's it!

### Updating a fountain's picture
Water fountains aren't always dirty or always clean, so Fountain Pix let's
you add multiple pictures of the same fountain. To do this, find the
fountain you'd like to update on your school's page and visit its page.
Then, use the controls at the bottom to add a photo.

### Rating water fountains
No one is claiming that high school water fountains are teeming with
harmful bacteria and deadly toxins. This is about students' perceptions
of how clean or dirty a given fountain appears. It's inherently subjective.

FountainPix let's anyone rate how clean (0-5 scale) they think a given
fountain looks as well as share whether or not they would drink from it.
The form for doing this is at the bottom of the fountain page, whose link
is easily shareable on social media. Schools receive an overall rating
based on the ratings of its individual water fountains.

### Deleting pictures and schools
Only the person who uploaded a picture can delete it. When all of the
pictures associated with a water fountain are deleted, that fountain
is automatically removed.

Schools can only be deleted if they don't have any water fountains
associated with them on the site. Again, only the person who originally
created the school can delete it.

If you intend to host this code yourself for your own local water fountain
accountability project, contact me and I'll explain the admin feature
that let's authorized users delete any picture or school.
